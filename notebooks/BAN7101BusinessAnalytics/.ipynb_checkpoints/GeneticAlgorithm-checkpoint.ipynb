The objective is to minimize total flow costs among the placed facilities.\n",

For this QAP assignment, I will encoding the solution using one dementional Numpy array which holds 15 unique number in range $[0, 15)$. For example, $[ 1, 2, 8, 0, 6, 12, 11,10, 4, 5, 3, 13, 14, 7, 9]$ could be one of my solution representation that indicates department 1 should be placed at location 1, department 2 is placed at location 2 and department 8 is at location 3 etc.\n",

    ">1. Size: Typically, the population consists of N individuals (solutions), where N is problem-dependent (often between 20 and 500).\n",
    ">2. Encoding: Each individual is represented as a chromosome (binary string, real-valued vector, or permutation).\n",

    ">Crossover is a key genetic operator in Genetic Algorithms (GA) used to combine genetic information from two parent solutions to produce new offspring. This mimics biological reproduction and helps explore the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation\n",
    "> Mutation is another key genetic operator in Genetic Algorithms (GA) used to introduce randomness into the population. It mimics the natural mutation process, ensuring that small changes are made to the genetic material of individuals, which helps maintain diversity in the population and prevents the algorithm from prematurely converging to a local optimum."
