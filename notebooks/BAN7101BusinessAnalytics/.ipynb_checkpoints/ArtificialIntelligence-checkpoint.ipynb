    "**ChatGPT's answer:** Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, among others. The goal of AI is to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation."

    "Similar to Gradient Decent Algorithms, the Genetic algorithms are heuristic optimization algorithms but GA is inspired by the process of natural selection. They are used to find solutions to complex optimization and search problems. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Initialization: Generate an initial population of solutions randomly.\n",
    "2. Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of each solution in the population.\n",
    "3. Selection: Select the best-fit individuals for reproduction (parents) based on their fitness.\n",
    "4. Crossover: Create new individuals (offspring) by combining the genetic material of the parents.\n",
    "5. Mutation: Introduce random changes (mutation) to the offspring's genetic material.\n",
    "6. Replacement: Replace the current population with the new population of offspring.\n",
    "7. Termination: Repeat steps 2-6 until a termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations or reaching a satisfactory solution).\n",
