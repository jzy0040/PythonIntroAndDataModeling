    "# Mathematical Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "also known as mathematical programming, is a set mathematical technique that deals with finding the best solution from a set of possible/alternative solutions to a given problem. The goal/objective of optimization is to minimize or maximize a certain objective function while satisfying a set of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally divided into two subfields: discrete optimization and continuous optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a discrete optimization, in which an object such as an integer, permutation or graph must be found from a countable set.\n",

    "**History**\n",
    "\n",
    "Also know as OR, modern operational research originated at the Bawdsey Research Station in the UK in 1937 as the result of an initiative of the station's superintendent, A. P. Rowe and Robert Watson-Watt. In the decades after the two world wars, the tools of operations research were more widely applied to problems in business, industry, and society. Since that time, operational research has expanded into a field widely used in industries ranging from petrochemicals to airlines, finance, logistics, and government, moving to a focus on the development of mathematical models that can be used to analyse and optimize sometimes complex systems, and has become an area of active academic and industrial research.\n",
