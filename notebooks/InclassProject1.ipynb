    "### This is a simple Python project for Final Letter Grade Entering system. The requirements are as following:\n",
    "1. The input data, an Excel file, contains 5 assignments(150 points each), 10 discussion boards(10 points each), 15 in-class participation(10 points each).\n",
    "2. All possible points are 1000.\n",
    "3. The grading scale is A for 93 and above, A- for 90 to 92.99. B+ for 87 to 89.99, B for 83 to 86.99, B- for 80 to 82.99. C-, C, and C+ are same idea as B-, B, B+, so as D-, D, D+. Everything below 60 is F.\n",
    "4. According to the university policy, the passing letter grade is C or higher.\n",
    "5. Please perform basic analysis, for example, how many student got each letter grade. What's the passing rate...\n",
    "6. This process will be needed each semester. A readable, reliable, and compact Python code is prefered.\n",
    "7. By the end of the project, please generate a brief report using Python. "
