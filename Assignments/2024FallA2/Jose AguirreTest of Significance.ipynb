    "Here is the project:  A company wants to test whether the average time taken to assemble a product has significantly decreased after implementing a new training program. Prior to the training, the average assembly time was 35 minutes with a known population standard deviation of 5 minutes. After the training, a random sample of 40 employees showed a mean assembly time of 33 minutes. Can you help the company to decide whether the new training program is necessary?\n",

    "-  The null hypothesis Ho is the average assembly time after training is equal to the average time right before the training (u=35 minutes)\n",
    "-  The alternative hypothesis (Ha) will be the average assembly time after training and will be less than the average time before training (u<35 minutes)\n",
    "-  Determine the Test Static.  We will use the z-test formula since the population standard deviation is known.\n",
