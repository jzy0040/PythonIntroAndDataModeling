    "1.  For Machine X: 2𝑥+𝑦+3𝑧≤100\n",
    "    Each unit of Product A requires 2 hours of Machine X.\n",
    "    Each unit of Product B requires 1 hour of Machine X.\n",
    "    Each unit of Product C requires 3 hours of Machine X.\n",
    "    Therefore, if the company produces 𝑥 units of Product A, \n",

    "Machine Y is available for only 85 hours per week, so the hours used cannot exceed 85. This gives us the constraint.\n",

    "Both machines are binded based off the constraints in this scenario.  The folowing should be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision for Upgrading\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Impact of Upgrading each machine:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Upgrading Machine X: Since it's fully utilized, increasing its available hours could allow for producing more units of Products B and C, as they\n",
    "    contribute significantly to total output.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Upgrading Machine Y: Similarly, upgrading Machine Y will also allow for an increase in production since it's also at capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Comparative Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "    To determine which machine to upgrade, consider which machine has more potential for increasing production. In this case:\n",
    "    The production times per unit for each product may suggest that Machine Y's upgrades could yield a greater increase in output, especially given that\n",
    "    Product B and C both require relatively less time from Machine Y compared to Machine X.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Additionally, if you observe that production is currently constrained by Machine X or if a significant portion of the output would be affected by\n",
    "    increasing Machine Y's hours, you may prioritize the upgrade of Machine Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a budget for upgrading, the analysis indicates that either machine upgrade could potentially yield increased output, but you should favor \n",
    "upgrading the machine that is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    More heavily utilized in production (both are, but analyze specific needs of production levels).\n",
    "    Has more significant production time savings for the products with higher outputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In practice, you could also conduct sensitivity analysis to explore how varying the availability of machine hours impacts the optimal production levels,\n",
    "which would provide additional insights into which machine to upgrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we explore the math model in this linear model, each machine's constraint is represented by an inequality based of the hours.  Here are the constraints:\n",
    "Machine X Constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "2𝑥𝐴+1𝑥𝐵+3𝑥𝐶≤100\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint means that the total time Products A, B, and C require on Machine X cannot exceed 100 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit of Product A takes 2 hours, Product B takes 1 hour, and Product C takes 3 hours on Machine X.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the optimal solution, we calculated that Machine X uses exactly 100 hours, so it’s a binding constraint (meaning it’s fully utilized and limiting \n",
    "production).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Y Constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "4𝑥𝐴+3𝑥𝐵+2𝑥𝐶≤85\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint means the total time spent on Machine Y by all products cannot exceed 85 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit of Product A requires 4 hours, Product B takes 3 hours, and Product C takes 2 hours on Machine Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the optimal solution, Machine Y also uses exactly 85 hours, making it another binding constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both constraints are binding, they both limit production output. Therefore, upgrading either machine will allow more units of Products B and C to be produced, as both machines are fully utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deciding Which Machine to Upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine which machine to upgrade, let’s analyze:\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, the Time Requirements Per Unit: Products B and C have relatively balanced usage across both machines, but upgrading Machine Y might yield a more favorable outcome because it has slightly lower time requirements per unit for the higher-output products (B and C).\n",
    "Final Recommendation\n",
    "An upgrade to either Machine X or Y would result in increased production, but if forced to choose one based on this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Upgrading Machine Y may provide a slightly greater flexibility in production increases due to the lower time requirements for Products B and C, which contribute the most to the optimal production output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, analyzing the math model indicates that while both machines are at capacity, upgrading Machine Y could offer a marginally better impact on increasing production output given its use across the high-output products in this setup.\n",
